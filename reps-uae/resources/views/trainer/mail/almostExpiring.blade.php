<p>Dear REPs member,</p>

<p>This is a further reminder that your annual membership is due to expire in one month.</p>
 
<p>You can register for another 12 months on our new REPs UAE website at <a href="http://www.repsuae.com">www.repsuae.com</a> Just click on RENEW or log in to your personal dashboard on the website where you can renew and pay online from there.  If you do not know your personal log in details then you can click “Forgot Password” and you will be sent a new password. There is also an option to pay by cash at the REPs office.  </p>

<p>The annual REPs registration fee remains at Dhs420 (VAT incl.), which you must pay within the next two months in order for your membership to remain active.  We will allow a 30 days grace period from the end date of your current registration, after which a penalty of 100 AED will be added. </p> 
 
<p>If you were given <strong>‘Provisional Status’</strong> you should have upgraded to a UAE accredited certification OR at the very least be on a course or booked and paid to undertake a course. If you have already done this, upon renewal just upload your new certificate OR you may do this at any time via your dashboard and click on ‘Convert Provisional to Full’. For further assistance and clarification contact <a href="mailto:membership@repsuae.com">membership@repsuae.com</a> </p>

<p>For <strong>‘Full Status Members’</strong>, we would also like to remind you of the REPs requirement to gain 10 CPD Points (10 hours) of continuing professional development/ continuing education.  You can see all the course options for CPD on the REPs website under Approved Training.  When you renew your membership you will be asked to upload certificates from any courses or events you have attended in the last year. </p>

<p>REPs UAE has gone from strength to strength over the last year with well over 1000 members now registered.  We have support from all of the major fitness clubs who insist that all their instructors are registered.  The Dubai Sports Council have also made it a legal requirement for fitness instructors in Dubai to be registered and recently sent a circular to all clubs to that effect.  We hope you have been enjoying the REPs Quarterly Magazine this year and taking advantage of the REPs member benefits which are also listed on the website.  Latest news is also featured on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/REPSUAE">REPs UAE Facebook</a> page. </p> 

<p>Once you have completed the renewal process, we will be pleased to issue you with your new REPs ID Card and REPs member certificate.  </p>

<p>If you have any questions please contact us on <a href="mailto:faisal.ayaz@sigmads.com">faisal.ayaz@sigmads.com</a> or call on +971 4 340 7407</p>
